Cleaning the data:  

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. We need to clean the data depending on our work.   In our case, we need to remove words like RT, Tweet, numerical values, dates, #, urls, <, > etc. We need to remove the verbs too. We need to see the data and plan the cleaning process.  

We need to sort them and take the top 25 or 50 frequently used words. 

We can use correlation coefficient formula (from any standard statistics books) on these numbers.

# ResearchProject
This is an informal text mining research project, mainly for practice

Aim: 
To identify the frequently used words in a particular keyword. 
To identify the relation between the keywords using the word usage  


Please follow the below instructions carefully.

STEP 1: 
1.	The data belongs to two months. 
2.	Each file contains the tweets collected on that day. 
3.	Each day file needs to be cleaned.  Only one day data of a particular tweet should be in one file.  
4.	Keep file name with date and tweet keyword. 
5.	Remove stop words and clean the data. 
6.	Compute Term Document Matrix (TDM) with the words used by each keyword and each day.  
7.	Consider the frequently used 25 or 50 words from each day tweet.  
8.	Prepare a excel sheet with date as column and frequently used words as rows. 
9.	Find the correlation coefficient between the words of a particular keyword. 

Please let me know when you done with step 1. 



STEP 2: 
1.	Once STEP 1 is completed, we can address the correlation between the keywords too. 
2.	Learn some Machine learning Algorithms
